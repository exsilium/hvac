# Synopsis #

The goal of this project is to create a simple Central Heating Control Unit which is able to operate in stand-alone mode. Basic settings are controlled manually. RS485 interface will be provided in the future for plugging the controller into other automation networks.

The project is based on Arduino and all artifacts will be collected to this repository. Code, schematics, pcb layout, inventory etc.
